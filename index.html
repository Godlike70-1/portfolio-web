            <p>My name is Manji Aayam Maharjan, and I am a cybersecurity researcher with a deep-rooted passion for understanding and securing the ever-evolving digital landscape. From an early stage, technology has fascinated me—not just in how it functions, but in how it can be protected from emerging threats. My journey into cybersecurity has been driven by a strong curiosity to explore new technologies, stay ahead of cyber threats, and contribute meaningfully to the field. I thrive on challenges that require analytical thinking, strategic problem-solving, and continuous learning. Whether it's diving deep into vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, or researching novel attack vectors, I am constantly seeking ways to sharpen my skills and expand my knowledge. I believe that cybersecurity is not just about defense but about building trust in technology and empowering innovation with safety. Through hands-on projects, collaborative learning, and real-world simulations, I’ve developed a strong technical foundation and a mindset focused on ethical responsibility. My goal is to grow not only as a cybersecurity expert but also as someone who contributes positively to the tech community by sharing insights, tools, and secure practices. I am excited to continue exploring, learning, and pushing boundaries in this fast-paced and impactful field.
